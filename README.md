## Bank Marketing Campaign Prediction
This project applies Logistic Regression and data analysis techniques to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a bank term deposit based on demographic and campaign-related data.

## Overview
The project uses the Bank Marketing Dataset, performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and logistic regression modeling to generate actionable business insights. The aim is to help marketing teams optimize customer targeting for subscription campaigns.

## Skills & Techniques Applied
## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Removed redundant/unnamed columns.

Handled categorical variables and missing data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution plots to understand feature behavior.

Relationship analysis between predictors and target variable.

## Feature Engineering

Encoding categorical features.

Selecting relevant predictors based on statistical significance.

## Model Building & Evaluation

Logistic Regression using scikit-learn and statsmodels.

Train-test split for unbiased evaluation.
